In this section we are going to explore how property values can be bound to structured objects through `@ConfigurationProperties`.

First, we need to annotate `Application.groovy` with `@ComponentScan`.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/init/example/grails/Application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/init/example/grails/Application.groovy[]
----

<1> `@ComponentScan` tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the specified package. Spring is able to auto scan, detect and register your beans or components from pre-defined project package. If no package is specified current class package is taken as the root package.

Create a file named `AddressConfiguration.groovy`.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/grails/AddressConfiguration.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/grails/AddressConfiguration.groovy[]
----

<1> We have added the `@Configuration` annotation for Spring to be able to find this bean and make it a candidate for injection.
<2> The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation takes the configuration prefix.

Any properties defined in the property file that has the prefix `address` and the same name as one of the properties are automatically assigned to this object.

Add some properties to `application.yml`

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=address]
----
